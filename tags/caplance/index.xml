      <description>ðŸŽ‰ We made it! ðŸŽ‰ After 6 months of work, Caplance is finally at MVP. The brief release notes can be found here.
To get to MVP, I had to implement the following functionality:
 Logging Config file parsing  Combining all the previous updates, we get the following feature set for the MVP:
 Packet listening Packet forwarding over UDP Direct reply from backends, allowing the load balancer to only have to handle incoming traffic Dynamic backend registration and deregistration Backend commands and health checks Logging Config file parsing  I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly cover the improvements so far and then give a short demo of Caplance working.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back! Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve had much more time to work on Caplance than I had in the prior months, so, naturally, a ton of work has gotten done in these few weeks. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented the following functionality:
 Backend registration The following controls from the backends:  PAUSE DEREGISTER RESUME HEALTH  caplancectl to tell a running client process to issue one of those commands Graceful stop for backends Packet listening on NFQUEUE Refactor project structure  If you&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping track, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that this puts us very close to the Caplance MVP!</description>

      <description>While working on my load balancer, Caplance, I ran into a very strange error when trying to establish a connection between a client and a backend. Before I go to deep, though, let me give a quick intro into how TCP connection establishment works.
Types of Message When establishing a TCP connection, there are 4 possible packet types you could see:
 SYN (S in tcpdump) - Always the first message sent.</description>

      <description>After countless hours spent reading the GoDocs, googling &amp;ldquo;gre packets golang&amp;rdquo;, and staring at the term SIGSEV, I&amp;rsquo;ve got an update! I&amp;rsquo;ve made pretty significant progress on the actual load balancer, implementing most of the base functionality. So far, the load balancer can:
 listen for and ingest whole IP packets select the backend for a packet based on a combination of IP and source port encapsulate packets in UDP and send them to the appropriate backend attach a specified virtual IP  I&amp;rsquo;ve also implemented some extremely rudimentary testing and setup, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to rework those once the project structure solidifies some more.</description>
