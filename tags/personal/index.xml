      <description>From Sunday, 3/10/19 to today, Tuesday 5/21/19, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving. During that time, I decided on a single, small improvement to make each week, and I tried to execute on it. Each week, I&amp;rsquo;d outline the motivation behind my decision, the tools I&amp;rsquo;d be using, and the rules I&amp;rsquo;d have to follow during the week. The next week, I&amp;rsquo;d write a short reflection on how I thought the week went with respect to my adherence to the rules I set.</description>

      <description>Like the water, the Walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint, but at a distance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from the white ice of the river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a quarter of a mile off. Sometimes one of those great cakes slips from the ice-man&amp;rsquo;s sled into the village street, and lies there for a week like a great emerald, an object of interest to all passers.</description>
