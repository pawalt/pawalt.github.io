      <description>From Sunday, 3/10/19 to today, Tuesday 5/21/19, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving. During that time, I decided on a single, small improvement to make each week, and I tried to execute on it. Each week, I&amp;rsquo;d outline the motivation behind my decision, the tools I&amp;rsquo;d be using, and the rules I&amp;rsquo;d have to follow during the week. The next week, I&amp;rsquo;d write a short reflection on how I thought the week went with respect to my adherence to the rules I set.</description>
